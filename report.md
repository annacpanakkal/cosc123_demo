# This is the title

This is just a random text

For *italics style* text, just surround the words with single star

## This is a level two heading

If you want **bold** text, just surround the words with double star

### This is a level three heading

If you want to make a list, use dashers:

- item 1
- item 2

If you want to make a numbered list:

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

this is a break

1. item A
1. item B
1. item C

(numbering wrong example)
